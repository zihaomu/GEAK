PARSE_TASK_INFO_USER_TEMPLATE = """Analyze the following optimization task and extract configuration information.

Extract the following information (return null if not found):
1. kernel_name: The name of the kernel/function being optimized (e.g., "gemm", "matmul", "conv2d")
2. kernel_url: The path or URL to the SPECIFIC KERNEL FILE to optimize. This MUST be a path
   ending in a file extension (e.g. ``.py``, ``.hip``, ``.cu``, ``.flydsl``), NOT a directory.
   If the task only mentions a directory and says something like "the kernel is in <DIR>",
   set this to ``<DIR>/kernel.py`` (or the appropriate extension for the kernel_type) -- do
   NOT return the bare directory.
3. kernel_type: Kernel type, strictly one of "hip", "triton", "tilelang", "pytorch2flydsl", "flydsl", or "other".
   Use "pytorch2flydsl" when the task mentions translating PyTorch code to FlyDSL, converting PyTorch to FlyDSL, or pytorch2flydsl translation.
   Use "tilelang" when the task is about optimizing existing TileLang / tile-lang code.
   Use "flydsl" when the task is about optimizing existing FlyDSL code (not translating from PyTorch).
4. repo: The repository path mentioned in the task (absolute path or relative path)
5. test_command: The command to run tests or benchmarks
6. metric: The performance metric to measure (e.g., "bandwidth in GB/s", "latency in ms", "throughput")
7. num_parallel: Number of parallel optimization agents to run (integer)
8. gpu_ids: Comma-separated GPU IDs for parallel execution (e.g., "0,1,2,3")
9. output_dir: Directory path where output logs and artifacts should be saved (e.g., "outputs/topk_run", "/workspace/results")
10. model: Model name or identifier to use (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "gpt-4o")
11. config: Path to a YAML configuration file (e.g., "configs/my_setup.yaml", "/path/to/config.yaml")

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with these keys. Example:
{{
  "kernel_name": "matmul",
  "kernel_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/kernel.py",
  "kernel_type": "triton",  // one of: "hip", "triton", "tilelang", "pytorch2flydsl", "flydsl", "other"
  "repo": "/path/to/repo",

  "gpu_ids": "0,1,2,3",
  "output_dir": "outputs/matmul_run",

PARSE_PIPELINE_PARAMS_USER_TEMPLATE = """Analyze the following task and extract GPU kernel optimization pipeline parameters.

Extract the following (return null if not found or not applicable):
1. kernel_url: The path or URL to the SPECIFIC KERNEL FILE to optimize (e.g., "/path/to/silu.hip", "/workspace/kernels/matmul.py", "https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/kernel.py"). This is the kernel source file itself, NOT the repository root directory.
2. preprocess_dir: Path to a directory containing existing preprocessing artifacts (e.g., "/path/to/geak_output"). Only set if the user explicitly mentions reusing existing artifacts.
3. heterogeneous: Whether to use heterogeneous mode (diverse optimization strategies across GPUs). Set true if the user mentions "heterogeneous", false if they mention "homogeneous", null if not mentioned.
4. max_rounds: Maximum number of optimization rounds (integer). Only set if explicitly mentioned.
5. start_round: Round number to resume from (integer, 1-based). Only set if explicitly mentioned.
6. pipeline_intent: true if the task describes kernel optimization, performance improvement, GPU kernel work, or profiling. false if it describes general coding tasks like bug fixes, refactoring, or feature additions.
7. mode: Wall-clock budget profile -- "quick" or "full". Only set if the user explicitly chooses one.
   - "quick" -> ~1-hour total budget. Triggered by phrases like: "quick mode", "quick run",
     "fast run", "quick optimization", "1 hour", "one hour", "1h", "shorter run", "tight budget",
     "smoke test the optimization", "limit to 60 minutes", "--mode quick", "mode=quick".
   - "full" -> ~2-hour total budget. Triggered by phrases like: "full mode", "full run",
     "thorough run", "long run", "2 hours", "two hours", "2h", "extended run", "deep optimization",
     "--mode full", "mode=full".
   - null if neither is mentioned. Do NOT infer a mode from the kernel size or complexity --
     only set when the user explicitly chooses one.

EXTRACT_USER_CONSTRAINTS_TEMPLATE = """Analyze the following optimization task and extract mandatory constraints and prescribed optimization directives.

Extract TWO categories:

1. **constraints**: Hard rules that MUST NOT be violated (rejection criteria).
   Look for:
   - Function name constraints ("function name MUST be exactly X", "do NOT rename")
   - Signature constraints ("function signature MUST be identical")
   - Numerical correctness requirements ("output must be numerically identical")
   - Compatibility constraints ("keep all template parameters compatible")
   - Forbidden actions ("do NOT modify the test harness")
   - Any other explicit MUST / MUST NOT / DO NOT rules

2. **directives**: Prescribed optimization strategies that agents SHOULD follow as their primary approach, while retaining freedom to explore additional directions beyond these.
   Look for:
   - Specific optimization strategies ("tune block sizes", "optimize shared memory usage")
   - Memory access guidance ("improve memory coalescing", "vectorize loads/stores")
   - Architecture-specific tuning ("tune for MI355X gfx950 304 CUs")
   - Performance targets ("close efficiency gap toward 75-100% of peak HBM bandwidth")

Do NOT extract:
- Hardware descriptions without an actionable directive
- Model-level or end-to-end profiling numbers (e.g., "89.72 ms across 12288 invocations",
  "4.77% of total GPU compute time", "38.57% of 8.0 TB/s peak HBM bandwidth"). These come
  from full-model benchmarking under different conditions and MUST NOT be used as baselines
  for comparison. GEAK runs its own isolated baseline measurements.
- Workload context descriptions ("LLM inference serving", "decode path")
- File paths or kernel identifiers

IMPORTANT: Performance targets like "close efficiency gap toward 75-100% of peak bandwidth"
are valid directives. But absolute numbers from the user's profiling (durations, invocation
counts, efficiency percentages) are NOT — they reflect a different measurement environment.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Example:
{{
  "constraints": [
    "The output function name MUST be EXACTLY: topkGatingSoftmax. Do NOT rename it.",
    "The function signature MUST be IDENTICAL to the original.",
    "Output must be numerically identical to the original."
  ],
  "directives": [
    "Tune block sizes and wave occupancy for MI355X gfx950 (304 CUs).",
    "Optimize shared memory (LDS) usage for expert gating softmax.",
    "Improve memory coalescing for top-k routing output writes."
  ]
